# Airbnb Data Analysis and Modeling

This repository contains the analysis and modeling of short-term rental listings data from the Airbnb platform. The project aims to uncover insights and prepare the dataset for machine learning or statistical analysis.

## 📂 Data Source
- [Kaggle Airbnb Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramvir705/airbnb-data)

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze and model Airbnb rental data, identify patterns, and prepare the dataset for advanced predictive modeling.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Addressed missing values, inconsistent data types, and formatting issues.
  - Ensured data readiness for analysis and visualization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Identified trends, correlations, and distribution patterns in features like pricing, property types, and reviews.
  - Gained actionable insights into key variables.
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - Created insightful plots using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
  - Highlighted pricing trends, property distribution, and review statistics.
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Processed and transformed variables (e.g., `amenities`, `log_price`, and categorical features) for deeper analysis.
  - Prepared data for future machine learning tasks.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
